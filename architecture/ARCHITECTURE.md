# Architecture

Architecture diagrams were created based on [C4-Model](https://c4model.com/).

**Level 4** visualizing code structure was omitted due to simplicity of each component.


## Sources

Diagram sources are all stored in this directory and can be edited in [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net).

I personally recommend to install C4 plugin for App Diagrams. [Plugin](https://github.com/tobiashochguertel/c4-draw.io)
